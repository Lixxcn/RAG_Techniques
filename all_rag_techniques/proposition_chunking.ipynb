    "### 概述\n",
    "\n",
    "此代码实现了命题分块方法，基于 [Tony Chen 等人的研究](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2312.06648)。该系统将输入文本分解为原子性、事实性、独立且简洁的命题，并将这些命题编码到向量存储中，以便后续检索。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 关键组件\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **文档分块：** 将文档分割成易于管理的小块进行分析。\n",
    "2. **命题生成：** 使用大语言模型（LLM）将文档块分解为事实性、独立的命题。\n",
    "3. **命题质量检查：** 根据准确性、清晰度、完整性和简洁性评估生成的命题。\n",
    "4. **嵌入和向量存储：** 将命题和较大的文档块嵌入到向量存储中，以实现高效检索。\n",
    "5. **检索与比较：** 使用不同大小的查询测试检索系统，并比较基于命题的模型与基于较大块的模型的检索结果。\n",

    "\n",
    "### 动机\n",
    "\n",
    "命题分块方法背后的动机是构建一个系统，将文本文档分解为简洁、事实性的命题，以实现更精细、更精确的信息检索。使用命题可以实现更精细的控制，更好地处理特定查询，特别是从详细或复杂的文本中提取知识。比较使用较小的命题块和较大的文档块旨在评估精细信息检索的有效性。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 方法详情\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **加载环境变量：** 代码首先加载环境变量（例如，LLM 服务的 API 密钥），以确保系统能够访问必要的资源。\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **文档分块：**\n",
    "   - 使用 `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` 将输入文档分割成更小的部分（块）。这确保了每个块的大小都适合 LLM 处理。\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **命题生成：**\n",
    "   - 使用 LLM（在本例中为 \"llama-3.1-70b-versatile\"）从每个块生成命题。输出被构造为一系列事实性、独立的陈述，无需额外上下文即可理解。\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **质量检查：**\n",
    "   - 第二个 LLM 通过对准确性、清晰度、完整性和简洁性进行评分来评估命题的质量。在所有类别中都达到所需阈值的命题将被保留。\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **嵌入命题：**\n",
    "   - 通过质量检查的命题使用 `OllamaEmbeddings` 模型嵌入到向量存储中。这允许在进行查询时进行基于相似性的命题检索。\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **检索与比较：**\n",
    "   - 构建了两个检索系统：一个使用基于命题的块，另一个使用较大的文档块。两者都使用多个查询进行测试，以比较它们的性能和返回结果的精度。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 优点\n",
    "\n",
    "- **粒度：** 通过将文档分解为小的事实性命题，该系统可以实现高度特定的检索，从而更容易从大型或复杂的文档中提取精确的答案。\n",
    "- **质量保证：** 使用质量检查 LLM 确保生成的命题符合特定标准，从而提高了检索信息的可靠性。\n",
    "- **检索灵活性：** 基于命题和基于较大块的检索之间的比较，可以评估搜索结果中粒度与更广泛上下文之间的权衡。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 实现\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **命题生成：** LLM 与自定义提示结合使用，从文档块中生成事实性陈述。\n",
    "2. **质量检查：** 生成的命题通过一个评分系统，评估其准确性、清晰度、完整性和简洁性。\n",
    "3. **向量存储集成：** 命题在使用预训练的嵌入模型嵌入后存储在 FAISS 向量存储中，从而实现高效的基于相似性的搜索和检索。\n",
    "4. **查询测试：** 对向量存储（基于命题和较大块）进行多个测试查询，以比较检索性能。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 总结\n",
    "\n",
    "此代码提出了一种使用 LLM 将文档分解为独立命题的稳健方法。该系统对每个命题进行质量检查，将其嵌入向量存储中，并根据用户查询检索最相关的信息。比较精细命题与较大大文档块的能力，有助于深入了解哪种方法针对不同类型的查询能产生更准确或更有用的结果。该方法强调了高质量命题生成和检索对于从复杂文档中精确提取信息的重要性。"

    "Conventional Wisdom vs. Founder Mode\n",
    "The essay argues that the traditional advice given to growing companies—hiring good people and giving them autonomy—often fails when applied to startups.\n",
    "This approach, suitable for established companies, can be detrimental to startups where the founder's vision and direct involvement are crucial. \"Founder Mode\" is presented as an emerging paradigm that is not yet fully understood or documented, contrasting with the conventional \"manager mode\" often advised by business schools and professional managers.\n",
    "Unique Founder Abilities\n",
    "Founders possess unique insights and abilities that professional managers do not, primarily because they have a deep understanding of their company's vision and culture.\n",
    "Graham suggests that founders should leverage these strengths rather than conform to traditional managerial practices. \"Founder Mode\" is an emerging paradigm that is not yet fully understood or documented, with Graham hoping that over time, it will become as well-understood as the traditional manager mode, allowing founders to maintain their unique approach even as their companies scale.\n",
    "Challenges of Scaling Startups\n",
    "As startups grow, there is a common belief that they must transition to a more structured managerial approach. However, many founders have found this transition problematic, as it often leads to a loss of the innovative and agile spirit that drove the startup's initial success.\n",
    "Brian Chesky, co-founder of Airbnb, shared his experience of being advised to run the company in a traditional managerial style, which led to poor outcomes. He eventually found success by adopting a different approach, influenced by how Steve Jobs managed Apple.\n",
    "Steve Jobs' Management Style\n",
    "Steve Jobs' management approach at Apple served as inspiration for Brian Chesky's \"Founder Mode\" at Airbnb. One notable practice was Jobs' annual retreat for the 100 most important people at Apple, regardless of their position on the organizational chart\n",
    ". This unconventional method allowed Jobs to maintain a startup-like environment even as Apple grew, fostering innovation and direct communication across hierarchical levels. Such practices emphasize the importance of founders staying deeply involved in their companies' operations, challenging the traditional notion of delegating responsibilities to professional managers as companies scale.\n",
